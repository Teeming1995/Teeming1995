        <h1>Top 10 Desserts in Malaysia</h1>
        <br>

        <h2>1. Ice Kacang</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Shaved ice desserts are always a popular treat in the tropics.

            Ice kachang (ice with beans) evolved from the humble ice ball drenched with syrup to be the little ice mountain served in a bowl, drizzled with creamed corn, condensed milk, gula melaka and brightly colored syrups.
            
            Dig into it and you’ll discover other goodies hidden within – red beans, palm seeds and cubed jellies.</p>

        <h2>2. Apam Balik</h2>
        <br>
        <p>You haven’t truly experienced Malaysian food until you thrill your taste buds with this sweet treat.

            A pancake-style snack wedded with the compact package of an omelet, apam balik is stuffed with more than a sufficient amount of sugar, peanuts and the occasional sprinkle of corn – it’s a dish that’s constantly being reinvented.</p>

        <h2>3. Cendol</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Cendol is made with a few simple ingredients, but the combination of flavours and textures creates a unique and 
            delicious dessert. The main ingredients are shaved ice, coconut milk, palm sugar, and green jelly noodles. 
            The jelly noodles are made from rice flour and pandan leaves, which give them their green colour and fragrant aroma. 
            The palm sugar is melted and mixed with water to create a sweet syrup, which is then drizzled over the shaved 
            ice and jelly noodles. Finally, the coconut milk is poured over the top, creating a creamy and refreshing finish.</p>

        <h2>4. Bubur Cha Cha</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Bubur cha cha refers to a sweet dessert soup made with coconut milk and a mix of different ingredients like sago pearls, purple sweet potatoes, bananas, yams, grated coconut, coconut cream, and pandan leaves. It can be served hot or cold and can be eaten for breakfast or for dessert.

            Bubur cha cha is one of the most well-known Peranakan/Nyonya desserts. It’s common in parts of Southeast Asia where there’s a sizeable Peranakan population like Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, and Phuket.</p>

        <h2>5. Bubur Pulut Hitam</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Bubur pulut hitam refers to a type of Indonesian and Malaysian dessert porridge or pudding made with black glutinous rice (pulut hitam), coconut milk, pandan leaves, and palm sugar. Some recipes make it with red beans as well, the same red adzuki beans used in Chinese hong dou tang or red bean soup.

            Like many Southeast Asian sweet porridges, bubur pulut hitam is a popular Malysian dessert that can be eaten at any time of the day.</p>

        <h2>6. Bahulu</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Bahulu is a traditional Malay sponge cake or cookie that is popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, and other parts of Southeast Asia. It is typically enjoyed as a snack or dessert, especially during festive occasions such as Hari Raya (Eid al-Fitr) and Chinese New Year.

            Bahulu is known for its light and fluffy texture, with a slightly crisp outer layer. It is made from a simple batter consisting of flour, eggs, sugar, and sometimes coconut milk or pandan flavoring. The ingredients are mixed together to form a smooth batter, which is then poured into special Bahulu molds.</p>

        <h2>7. Sago Gula Melaka</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Sago gula melaka is another of my favorite Malaysian desserts. It’s a simple but delicious pudding made with sago pearls, palm sugar syrup (gula melaka), coconut milk, and pandan leaves.

        <h2>8. Muah Chee</h2>
        <br>
        <p>From the name, can you guess what this next Malaysian dessert is like? Muah chee is basically the Chinese version of Japanese mochi. Popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore, it’s a chewy dessert or snack made with glutinous rice flour coated with peanut powder, sugar, and toasted sesame seeds.
