        <h2>7. Ramly Burger</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Ramly Burger is a popular Malaysian street food burger that has become a cultural icon in Malaysia. 
            
            A Ramly Burger typically consists of a beef or chicken patty (or sometimes a combination of both), seasoned with spices and flavorings, such as soy sauce and pepper. The patty is often wrapped in an egg omelette, which adds an extra layer of flavor and texture. Other common ingredients include lettuce, onions, mayonnaise, chili sauce, and sometimes cheese.
            
            One of the distinctive features of a Ramly Burger is the way it is prepared. The patty is often flattened and grilled on a flat-top griddle, allowing it to cook quickly and evenly. The egg omelette is then wrapped around the patty as it cooks, creating a flavorful casing.

        <br>
        <p>The popular Malay snack of goreng pisang (banana fritters) is one of those dishes that has variations in banana-growing countries around the world.
