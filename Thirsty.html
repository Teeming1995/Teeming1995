        <h2>4. Ipoh White Coffee</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Ipoh White Coffee is a famous Malaysian coffee beverage that originated from the city of Ipoh in the state of Perak, Malaysia. It is renowned for its unique roasting and preparation method, which gives the coffee its distinctive flavor and aroma.

The roasting process also reduces the acidity of the coffee, resulting in a smoother and milder flavor profile.</p>
