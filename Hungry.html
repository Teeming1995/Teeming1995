        <h1>Top 20 Malaysian Food</h1>
        <br>

        <h2>1. Mee Goreng Mamak</h2>
        <br>
        <p>This Indian Muslim dish is the complete package. Yellow noodles. Beef or chicken. Shrimp. Soy sauce, veggies and eggs. A bit of chili tossed in for an irresistible jolt.

            Sounds simple, right?
            
            Sadly, you can try to replicate this one at home, but it’s just not going to taste the way it did when you chowed down at that gritty Malaysian hawker stall.</p>

        <h2>2. Apam Balik</h2>
        <br>
        <p>You haven’t truly experienced Malaysian food until you thrill your taste buds with this sweet treat.

            A pancake-style snack wedded with the compact package of an omelet, apam balik is stuffed with more than a sufficient amount of sugar, peanuts and the occasional sprinkle of corn – it’s a dish that’s constantly being reinvented.</p>

        <h2>3. Nasi Lemak</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Nasi lemak is often referred to as Malaysia’s unofficial national dish.

            Basically, it’s rice cooked in coconut milk. But it’s the sides that matter.
            
            Depending on where you are in Malaysia, it comes with a variety of accompaniments such as hard-boiled egg, peanuts, vegetables, lamb/chicken/or beef curry, seafood and sambal (chili-based sauce).
            
            Nasi lemak is traditionally eaten for breakfast but these days people are ordering it any time of day.</p>

        <h2>4. Nasi Kerabu</h2>
        <br>
        <p>If the blue rice doesn’t spark your curiosity, the lines of people around the country waiting to order this favorite Kelantanese dish should.

            From the state of Kelantan in northern peninsular Malaysia, nasi kerabu gets its eye-grabbing color from telang flowers, which are crushed and mixed into flour.
            
            The aquamarine dish is topped with bean sprouts and fried coconut, then drenched in spicy budu, a fermented fish sauce. In true Kelantan style, you use your hands to dig into this one.</p>

        <h2>5. Goreng Pisang</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The popular Malay snack of goreng pisang (banana fritters) is one of those dishes that has variations in banana-growing countries around the world.

            The deep-frying helps caramelize the natural sugars in the bananas, making them even sweeter than they were to begin with. Some of Malaysia’s Chinese versions have unusually delicate and puffy batter.</p>

        <h2>6. Char Kuey Teow</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The noodles are fried with pork lard, dark and light soy sauce, chili, de-shelled cockles, bean sprouts, Chinese chives and sometimes prawn and egg. Essential to the dish is good “wok hei” or breath of wok, the qualities and tastes imparted by cooking on a wok using high heat..</p>

        <h2>7. Satay</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Though considered by many to be a dish native to Thailand, satay is actually believed to have originated in Indonesia. Origins aside, can we all just agree that meat on a stick is good?

            Malaysia has its own variations of the grilled skewers, served nationwide in chicken, beef or pork forms (the latter in non-Muslim venues only).
            
            Sauces vary from region to region, including the peanut sauce that’s loved the world over.

        <h2>8. Rendang (beef, chicken or lamb)</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Though sometimes erroneously called a curry, Malaysian food aficionados point out that this chunky cauldron of coconut milk and spices is nothing of the sort.

           The difference is in how it’s prepared: slowly simmered (to let the meat absorb the spices) until the rosy liquid completely evaporates. A favorite, especially during festive seasons, rendang is found across Malaysia.</p>

        <h2>9. Popia basah (wet spring roll)</h2>
        <br>
        <p>A hefty sort of spring roll, popia basah speaks to those in need of the familiar crispy snack, but without the added oil.

            Not to be confused with wet rolls found in parts of Vietnam, popia basah comes complete with its own regional-specific flavor. In place of lettuce, the Malay wet spring roll has turnips, fried onions and bean sprouts.</p>

        <h2>10. Ikan Bakar</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The direct translation of this dish means “burned fish.”

            You shouldn’t let that turn you off. This is one tasty grilled bit of seafood.
            
            After being marinated in the all-important sambal, the fish is placed on a banana leaf and grilled over a flame. Great for sharing.</p>

        <h2>11. Roti Canai</h2>
        <br>
        <p>An Indian-inspired flatbread that’s also popular in Singapore, roti canai is made with flour, butter and water, though some will toss condensed milk in to sweeten it up.

            The whole concoction is flattened, folded, oiled and cooked on a heavily oiled skillet, resulting in a sublimely fluffy piece of bread with a crispy exterior. You can eat this one as a snack on its own or use it to scoop up a side of curry.</p>

        <h2>12. Kaya Toast</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Kaya is a sweet and fragrant coconut custard jam, slathered onto thin slices of warm toast with ample butter. It’s as divine as it sounds, particularly when downed with a cup of thick black coffee.

            Many locals have this for breakfast supplemented by two soft-boiled eggs with soy sauce and pepper.</p>

        <h2>13. Pasembur (Indian Rojak)</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Pasembur or Indian Rojak is an Indian Muslim rojak popular in Penang, and perhaps Kedah. This delicious salad consists of shredded jicama, cucumber, bean sprouts, eggs, tofu, and fritters. The sauce or dressing is made with sweet potatoes and spices. </p>

        <h2>14. Roti John</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Whoever John was, it’s apparent that he preferred his sandwiches made with grilled minced meat and egg in the middle of slim bread, and drowned in a confection of condiments.

            Mayonnaise, ketchup, barbecue and chili sauce – choose one or choose them all. </p>

        <h2>15. Nasi Kandar</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Nasi kandar is essentially rice served with your choice of toppings, which commonly include curry, fish, egg and okra. Everything is laid out buffet style, though you can also order a la carte.

            Found all over Malaysia, nasi kandar eateries are extremely popular, most open 24 hours and run by ethnic Indian Muslims. </p>

            Assam Laksa is a dish that serves as an ideal vessel for a well-balanced primary taste sensation. A sip of its rich and tangy fish broth opens the palate to sweet, sour, spicy, and savoury flavours. Other components of Assam Laksa comprise thick, translucent laifun (rice noodles), and garnished with a kaleidoscope of ingredients such as shredded boiled fish, chillies, bunga kantan (torch ginger flower), sliced cucumber, pineapples, raw onion, lettuce, mint leaves, and a wedge of lime.</p>

        <br>

            In Malaysian claypot chicken rice, the key ingredients typically include marinated chicken pieces, Chinese sausage (lap cheong), mushrooms, and sometimes salted fish or salted egg.
